[Pages 133-136]: "Q What is hypnotic rhythm? How do you use it to gain permanent mastery over human beings? A I will have to go back into time and space and give you a brief elementary description of how nature uses hypnotic rhythm. Otherwise you will not be able to understand my description of how I use this universal law to control human beings."

[Pages 158-160]: "Man, alone, has the power to establish his own rhythm of thought providing he exercises this privilege before hypnotic rhythm has forced upon him the influences of his environment."

Question: What is hypnotic rhythm according to the text?

Please provide a clear, concise answer based only on the provided passages, and mention the page numbers when citing."""
